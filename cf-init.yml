# 1. To understand how the user data is passed manually thorugh console while create the instancce.
# 2. To understand how to pass user data though cloud formation template. Here problem is we dont know whether user data is    executed successfully or not.
# 3. To overcome this problem, cfn init is used.
# cfn-init is used to retrieve and interpret the resource metadata , installing packages, creating files and starting services.
# cfn-signal is used with creation policy or wait condition, it helps to signal when application is ready.
# cfn-get-metadata is used to get the metadata details.
# cfn-hub is used to check any changes in metadata and execute custom hooks when noticed changes.
# cfn-init -> cfn-signal -> cfn-hub

# Please refer the cf-init-follow file for more details.
